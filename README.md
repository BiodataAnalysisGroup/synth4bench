# Synthetic Genomics Data Generation and Evaluation for the Use Case of Benchmarking Somatic Variant Calling Algorithms


This is the repository for the analysis that was presented as poster in ISMB/ECCB23, Lyon, France.

All data are open and available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8095898).



## Installation
1. To install Neat follow the intructions [here](https://github.com/ncsa/NEAT/blob/master/README.md#installation).
2. To install GATK-Mutect2 follow the intructions [here](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036194592-Getting-started-with-GATK4).
3. To install bam-readcount follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount/tree/master#installation).
4. To create the conda environment that was used for the analysis run `conda env create -f environment.yml`


## Execution
Here follows the list of all scripts and their description:

`01_SynthDataGeneration.sh` - This bach script calls NEAT in order to generate 10 individual synthetic data datasets.

- Input: fasta reference file
							 
- Output: fastq files with pair end reads, "golden" bam file and bai index file, "golden" vcf file

`02_bam-readcount_reports.sh` - 

`03_VariantCalling.sh` - 

`04_load_bam_reports.R` - 

`05_clean_and_annotate.R` - 

`06_position_annotation.R` - 

`07_bar_plots.R` - 

`07_bubble_plots.R` - 

`07_density_plot.R` - 

`07_reference_barplot.R` - 

`08_mutation_overlap.R` - 

`09_patchwork.R` - 

(The first 3 steps of the pipeline are optional since all the files are provided either in this repository or in the zenodo link.)
